# PizzaAppDemo
This app demonstrates the use of C# MVC, EF, and Google Maps Javascript API.

You should be able to run this app right away as there should be a Sample.mdf database file in the **/App_Data** folder. If you have issues, you can always run the scripts located in the DB Scripts folder which should include both schema and data. Then you just need to update your connection string and the edmx file.

Good luck!
